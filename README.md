# QuietLogs

A simple mod that eliminates annoying log spam from popular mods to keep your log files clean and readable.

## Why
This mod is made because Flan's Mod and moremobvariants was spamming my logs for like 20 GB every time I am playing the game.

## What it fixes

**Flan's Mod spam:**
- `Context[...] updated from '...' to '...'`
- `ContextHistory of [...] is overflowing?`

**MoreMobVariants spam:**
- `Unknown custom packet identifier: moremobvariants:main`
